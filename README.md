## ✨ What It Does

- Imports support ticket data (CSV format)
- Calculates resolution times based on open/close timestamps
- Compares resolution times against SLA targets (per priority)
- Flags SLA breaches using conditional formatting
- Generates summary charts for weekly review

## 📂 Files Included

- `sla_report_template.xlsx` – Excel file with pre-built formulas and structure
- `sample_ticket_data.csv` – Dummy ticket data for testing
- `sla_macro_code.txt` – Sample VBA macro script to automate calculations

## 💡 Why I Built This

I worked in a support team that manually created SLA reports each week. It was slow and error-prone. This tool reduced reporting time by 75% and improved consistency — and it required no expensive software.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Microsoft Excel
- VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)
- CSV Input

## 📘 How to Use

1. Open the `sla_report_template.xlsx` file
2. Paste your real ticket data into the appropriate sheet (follow the format in `sample_ticket_data.csv`)
3. Run the macro using ALT+F11 or from the Developer ribbon
4. View SLA pass/fail statuses and summary charts
